		I am <span name="summary">Roy Evan Sia</span> (aka <span name="contacts">@pr00t</span>), <span name="summary">a software developer based in Cebu City, Philippines</span>. In my current work, I primarily use <span name="skills">C++</span> with <span name="skills">Microsoft Visual Studio</span>. In my spare time, I enjoy reading tech news and watching movies and tv series, but occasionally, esp. on long weekends, you can find me fiddling with a <span name="skills">Notepad++</span>, trying to perfect my <span name="skills">HTML/CSS/Javascript</span> skills. So far, this has me produced these mini projects that include <span name="projects">colourclock</span> and <span name="projects">stopwatch</span> among <span name="projects">others</span>. So yes, I am <span name="summary">a web designer-slash-developer in progress</span>, as I'm also beginning to learn <span name="skills">PHP</span> and <span name="skills">Ruby on Rails</span>. You can check out my codes at <span name="projects">github</span>, just a warning though, some of my codes may be messy but I'm learning. I'm <span name="summary">currently available for some web design/development projects as a sideline job</span>. So if you think I have caught your attention, you can email me at <span name="contacts">roy.evan.sia@gmail.com</span> (no spam please!).
